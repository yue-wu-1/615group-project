A list of things to do to polish the package:

SMALL FUNCTION CHANGES
  1. Add a warning message if the Q-statistic is less than 0
  2. After performing SVD, print out the smallest singular value, and print a message if the SVD threshold is below that

NEW FUNCTIONS
  1. Add a matrix cleaning function
    a. removing perfectly correlated SNPs
    b. diagnosing if a matrix is not SPD using eigen()
    c. fixing a non-SPD matrix if desired (nearPD from Matrix)
  2. Add a function for simulating GWAS summary statistics based on an LD matrix (requires mvrnorm)

PACKAGE COMPONENTS
  1. Add sample LD matrices
  2. Add a tutorial that explains in detail how to run a result.
  3. Clean up and fix documentation
