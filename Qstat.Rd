\usage{
Qstat(
  center = NULL,
  bx,
  by,
  se_bx,
  se_by,
  R,
  weak_filter = FALSE,
  weak_thresh = NULL,
  SVD = FALSE,
  SVD_thresh = NA,
  reg = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{center}{Specify a center of choice from "index" "mean" "median"
"index" picks the most significant SNP as the representative
"mean" picks the mean of the ratios
"median" picks the median of the ratios}

\item{bx}{The beta of the exposure traits of the ancestry 1}

\item{by}{The beta of the outcome traits of the ancestry 2}

\item{se_bx}{The standard error of the beta of the exposure traits of the ancestry 1}

\item{se_by}{The standard error of the beta of the outcome traits of the ancestry 2}

\item{R}{The LD matrix}

\item{weak_filter}{filters out weak instruments below a certain squared z-score threshold}

\item{weak_thresh}{thresh of filter}

\item{SVD}{uses SVD to approximate the matrix inverse to get rid of the singular values below a certain threshold}

\item{SVD_thresh}{for inverse approximation by SVD}

\item{reg}{regularization parameter (if the threshold is set too high, your results will be biased!)}
}
